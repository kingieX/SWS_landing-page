                1. Support for HTTP 1.1: The web server would need to support the HTTP 1.1 protocol, which is the most recent version of HTTP. <br>
                2. Handling of GET requests: The web server would need to be able to handle GET requests, which are used to retrieve resources such as web pages and images. <br>

                <span  id="more-0">
                    3. Response headers: The server would need to generate appropriate response headers, such as "Contene-Type" and "Content-Length", to inform the client about the nature of the response and its size. <br>
                    4. Status codes: The server would need to generate appropriate status codes, such as 200 OK, 404 Not Found and 500 Internal Server Error, to inform the client about the success or failure of the request.

            <p class="msg">
                Language: The language of choice used in the development of the server is C. <br>
                Why C language?<br>
                We made use of C language because it provides low-level control over the networking stack and system resources. </p>
                <span id="more-1">Libraries: The libraries used in the development of the server are: <br>
                1. libuv: A cross-platform asynchronous I/O library that provides a high-level abstraction for managing networking and file I/O operations. <br>
                2. HTTP Parser: A small, fast, and easy-to-use library for parsing HTTP messages in C applications. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it ideal for use in embedded systems or other resource-constrained environments.
